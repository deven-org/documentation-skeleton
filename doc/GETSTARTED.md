## Team Overview

We encourage you to use this section to provide information about the team your new colleague will work in. Please also mark the people who are main contact persons for overall organisational tasks, e.g. Scrum Master. You can list the names, disciplines, also add photos if you like. Since most projects work mainly remote it's nice to have some names and faces in place.

## Regular Meetings

In this section you can add a list of regular meetings like scrum ceremonies or review meetings. You could also add a screenshot of your team calender if you have something in place.

## Communication Channels

Please list the different communication channels you use within your project, like Slack groups or mailing lists. If necessary provide details on whom each communication channel adresses and how to access them.

## Access Checklist

Please provide a complete list with all the accesses that your new colleage will need when working in your project. Every entry should have a description on how to recieve access and a contact person or link to access more information if needed.

## How to get support

This section should provide the new joiner with all possible ways to get further support, like a link to the UHD Slack channel or contact persons. This should also include a link to the Code of Conduct.

## Link Archive

Here you can paste all the links with short, explanatory titles that can be useful for others. E.g. links to design files, Confluence or Wiki Pages, Ticket Guidelines etc.
