## How to start

In this section you're supposed to provide the user with a step by step guide on how to install and use your project. We've added an example below to give you an idea of how you could structure your guide.

1. First, create a folder and a package.json file
   ```sh
   $ mkdir my-app
   $ cd my-app
   $ npm init -y
   ```

2. Next, install the app and save it as dependency

   ```sh
