# Glossary

In this chapter you should start a list of all the project specific terms and their explanations that people new to the project won't know. Also words that people might know but are extremely important, like some technical terms, should be written down here. There can't be too much explanation, so don't heistate to write down all weird words and abbreviations that come to your mind when you think back to your own first days at the project.
