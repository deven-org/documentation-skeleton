## Background

The project was born out of the idea to make documentation creation easier for developers.
It is a starting point for documentations and with the added comments in each file it helps developers to get an idea what can or should be documented.

## Strategy

The documentation skeleton can by installed as an npm package but is not limited to that.
The idea is that any tech project regardless of the technologies used can use and profit from the documentation skeleton.

## Tech Changes

The first few packages of the documentation skeleton were published in the npm registry of GitHub.
From version 2.1.0 on the package is now available in the [registry of npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deven-org/documentation-skeleton).
